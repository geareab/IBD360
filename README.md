# IBD 360


This project presents the process for developing a mobile application to enhance the management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Given the chronic nature of IBD, traditional management methods often lead to fragmented communication, inconsistent symptom tracking, and poor adherence to treatment plans, resulting in suboptimal patient outcomes and increased healthcare costs. 

The application, developed using the Flutter framework and Firebase for backend services, addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive platform for symptom and medication tracking, secure real-time messaging, personalized reminders, and remote patient monitoring. Key functionalities include patient profile management, detailed symptom logging, medication tracking with reminders, secure communication channels, and real-time data synchronization. Evaluation results demonstrate the application's effectiveness in improving patient adherence to treatment plans, enabling proactive disease management, and reducing healthcare costs by preventing severe flare-ups and complications. 

Future enhancements, such as advanced data analytics, machine learning integration, wearable device compatibility, and electronic health record (EHR) integration, are proposed to further increase the application's capabilities and impact. This project signifies a notable progress in IBD management, providing a scalable, secure, and user-friendly solution that enhances patient outcomes and lessens the overall strain on healthcare systems. The continuous collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients, and technology experts will be essential for the application's ongoing development and success.
